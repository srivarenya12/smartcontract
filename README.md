# Project Title
# Error Handling Smart Contract

## Description

This Solidity smart contract demonstrates the usage of error handling statements such as `require()`, `assert()`, and `revert()` in Ethereum smart contract development. It includes examples of how to validate input conditions, assert internal consistency, and manually revert transactions with custom error messages.

## Getting Started

### Installing

* To use this smart contract, you can either copy the code directly or clone the repository from GitHub.

### Executing program

* To deploy and interact with the smart contract, you need an Ethereum development environment set up, such as Ganache for local development or a testnet like Rinkeby for testing on a public network.
* Compile the smart contract using a Solidity compiler, such as `solc` or Remix IDE.

* Deploy the compiled contract to your Ethereum environment using a deployment tool like Remix IDE, Truffle, or Hardhat.
* Interact with the deployed contract through a web3-enabled interface, such as Remix IDE, Truffle console, or your custom DApp.

## Help

* If you encounter any issues or have questions about using the smart contract, feel free to reach out to the contributors for assistance.
